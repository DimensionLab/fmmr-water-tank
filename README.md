Project commisioned for Faculty of materials, metallurgy and recyclation (FMMR) at Technical university of Ko≈°ice.

This simulator mainly showcases the capabilities of parametrized AI-based physics simulator leveraging scientific deep learning methods (physics-informed neural networks - PINNs). The simple geometry has 1 inlet at the top and 2 outlets at the bottom.
